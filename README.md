# our_lib: Genetic Algorithm Library
our_lib will be a new Python library that provides easy-to-use interface for solving optimization problems using evolutionary algorithms. Currently, our_lib is under heavy development and the project is incomplete. Despite being public repo, our_lib doesn't have open-source license yet - we will change that later.

# Why we need yet another library?
Our primary motivation is to provide very versatile library that implements a lot of different genetic operators for selection, crossover, mutation, etc. Besides that, we also aim for huge flexibility. This can be especially helpful for conducting scientific research, where novel ideas emerge.
