class NonUniformMutation(Mutation):
    """
    The class implements Non-uniform mutation, where a random gene in the chromosome is selected,
    and its value is replaced with another value from the surrounding of actual value. The
    size of this surrounding is initially big and decreasing with the progress of algorithm iterations.
    This allows the search to be global in the initial phases of the algorithm's execution,
    while becoming local in the final phases.
