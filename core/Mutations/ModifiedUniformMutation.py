class ModifiedUniformMutation(Mutation):
    """
  The class implements modified uniform mutation, where a random gene in the chromosome is selected,
    and its value is replaced with another value from the surrounding of actual value. The
    size of this surrounding is related to scaling K parameter. Initially value of this parameter is
    big and decreasing with the progress of algorithm iterations. This allows the search to be global
    in the initial phases of the algorithm's execution, while becoming local in the final phases.
